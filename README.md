# Renter

Renter is a simple app that allows tenants to quickly and easily interact with their landlords, and allows landlords to manage their tenants.

## Design Philosophy

Apps designed around helping tenants and landlords are often extremely slow, as they tend to be shells for websites that weren't even that fast to begin with. Renter is built from the ground-up with extreme speed in mind, and as such React (with Redux) was chosen on the front-end. To even further speed it up, *every* component is functional with the appropriate hooks.
